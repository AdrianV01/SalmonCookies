<div id = about> <h2> About Us </h2>
<p> In times not recorded in even the dustiest, most forlorn of grimoires, two men emerged
  from a bleak, obscure bog with a single idea. Being accustomed to feeding on only
  the most wretched of carrion and breathing in the fumes of peat and human misery,
  naturally the idea of combining salmon and cookies seemed more than just slightly good; it seemed
  to be of surpassing magnificence. We strive to cater to the needs of only the most
  discriminating hipster. Recline, read Foucault or Derrida, listen to Joy Division
  promptly after Schoenburg or John Zorn, and embrace a combination of flavors
  to match your skewed and calculated eclectic tastes. Indulge!
